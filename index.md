## Welcome to DMAonline

DMAonline aims to provide a simple, easy to use dashboard highlighting all information relating to research data management and related fields.

On this site expect to see development updates and posts on tools we are using or find interesting. You can also see some of the SaaS tools we are using and the companies we are thankful to for their support.

### SaaS Software Tools

#### BrowserStack

BrowserStack provides us with automated selenium testing on desktop and mobile browsers as well as live browser testing on a variety of platforms allowing us to easily diagnose UI bugs and issues brought to our attention. Expect to see us using this more as we get used to the platform and integrate it into all our SPA Developments

#### Sentry

Sentry provides us with centralised error monitoring so we can easily get indepth information about errors affecting the users of the DMAonline
